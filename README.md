# OldProjects
Old projects I made that aren't on Github (lost / embarrassing code), probably missing a load but it's a start :) Missing plenty of websites
that were created with WordPress etc over the years because that list would be endless.

## [Fractionn](http://web.archive.org/web/20160407013345/http://www.fractionn.com/) - 2013
Fractionn is a site which allows users to set target prices for products from hundreds of retailers such as Amazon and get notified if 
the product ever reaches the price. This is a project which I created for my 3rd year project in college
(since have taken it down, but it's on Archive.org).

## [.uk Domain Checker Tool](http://jamiefarrelly.com/uk-domain-checker-tool/) - 2013
Years ago a new domain extension was announced (.uk) and there were rumours that the oldest extension would get rights to that domain 
(e.g .co.uk, .org.uk). This tool that I made allows you to check which domain is the oldest without doing it manually one by one.

## [BulkyWhois](http://web.archive.org/web/20160324132209/http://www.bulkywhois.co.uk/) - 2014
Bulky WhoIs is a tool that I developed using BootStrap for the front end and Java for the back end after I realised that there weren't 
any good sites that allowed UK domainers to perform a bulk WhoIs search. The site saves people a huge amount of time by displaying 
relevant details about each domain such as the owner, expiry date, option to email the owner, purchase the domain 
(if it hasn't been registered yet) and so on. (since have taken it down, but it's on Archive.org)

## [LeapHotels](www.leaphotels.com) - 2016
Leap Hotels allows you to save money by staying in two hotels while you're away. It's the only site that allows you to do it and can actually save 
you a good bit of money!
